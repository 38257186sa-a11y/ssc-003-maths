  "questions": [
    {
      "q": "In a triangle the angles are in ratio 2:3:4. Find the largest angle.",
      "options": [
        "80\u00b0",
        "100\u00b0",
        "120\u00b0",
        "140\u00b0"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "hint": "Angles add to 180\u00b0, split in parts 2+3+4.",
      "explanation": "Total parts =9, largest =4/9 \u00d7180 =80? Wait compute: 4/9*180 = 80. So correct is 80\u00b0."

    {
      "q": "If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are:",
      "options": [
        "Equal",
        "Supplementary",
        "Complementary",
        "None"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "hint": "Corresponding angles occupy the same relative position.",
      "explanation": "Corresponding angles are equal when lines are parallel."
